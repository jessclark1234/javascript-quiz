## Description
The purpose of this application was to teach us how to use JavaScript to create a timed quiz with a highscore. This was to teach us how to better understand arrays, localStorage, connecting eventlisteners and functions.
## Usage
When the weboage is first loaded up, the 3 minute timer will start. For every question you get wrong, you will lose 10 seconds. For every question you get right, you will gain 5 seconds. Quickly answer the questions and test your knowledge on skincare!

## Instructions
N/A
## Contributions
I mainly used code from Week 4's classes. I also received help from my tutor, Andrew Hardemon, with bug fixes, making the code cleaner and understandng how to figure out which variables should go where.
